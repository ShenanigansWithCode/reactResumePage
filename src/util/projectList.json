        "need": "Quoting was slow, and manual. Stake holder approval was informal and inconsistently documented. Quotes were unorganized and difficult for customers to read.",
        "description": "Custom quoting app built on the Salesforce Lightning platform which integrates with Salesforce Sales Cloud and Krow PSA. Sales rep submits a quote request with validated input fields and documentation. Appropriate Salesforce object records are created, populated and moved to the appropriate process stage. Apex logic and approval rules determine if additional documentation or approval are needed and notifies the appropriate parties. Quotes are scheduled in a scrum based on quote urgency, timing and priority rules. Once all requirements are in place, a custom quote pdf is generated with all requested product groupings, discounts, custom descriptions and contract language added. A demo quote is generated in a headless chrome window produced by Heroku. Upon approval, an email with completed quote is e-mailed to the appropriate sales rep.",
